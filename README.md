# :rocket: [SearchSpace](https://searchspace.surge.sh/)
This project is a submission to [MindSumo's Nasa Image Archive](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/nasa-image-archive) Challenge.

## :question: What is it?
This is a front-end website built with React that uses NASA's API to search the image archive.

## :white_check_mark: Deployment
Surge.sh is used to deploy this static site (API is open access).

### :books: Important libraries
- Evergreen UI
- Axios (for ajax requests)
- Fontawesome
- React Router Dom

### :pencil: Things I learned
- Not to use Evergreen ever again (it does weird stuff when deployed to surge with styling)
- LOTS of react
- latency on search
- CSS styling (backgrounds especially)
